### Materials:

- Spray primer or Spray paint (I used U-POL Plast X 3 Primer Filler Plastic Repair Aerosol)
- Polishing Sandpaper (Grade P500 or finer)
- Rice
- Piece of plastic 0,047" (1,2 mm) thick (I used food a container).
- Cyanoacrylate plastic glue or any other glue suitable for plastic.
- Silicone sealant.
- Personal protection (glasses, rubber gloves, long-sleeve shirt, respirator)

### Prepare master model

The goal is to make it rigid enough to withstand the mass of polyurethane, smooth (non-porous) enough not to be adhered to polyurethane and leak-tight to avoid polyurethane penetration inside master model. 

1.  [3D-print Concrete Clock 1355 master model at Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/product/JNH4GTHWX/concrete-clock-1355-master-model) or [download](https://goo.gl/ICKVAU) it and 3D-print yourself.
2.  Coat it with thin layer of primer.
3.  Let it dry and make another thin layer. 
4.  Using sand paper polish it in a water bath (underwater).
5.  Grunt a thin layer again and let it dry. 
6.  Using sand paper polish it very lightly again in a water bath (underwater).
7.  Fill the master-model with rice to avoid model deformation when pouring polyurethane. 
8.  Seal the hole with any appropriate thin piece of plastic or any other non-porous smooth material. I used Cosmofen glue and silicon sealant to glue plastic to the master model.



## Make mold casing

<img alt="Make mold casing" src="http://i.imgur.com/pGpJQZm.png" /></a>

### Mold casing materials:

- Marker. I prefer white paint marker.
- Silicone sealant or Sulphur-Free Plasteline
- Laminated Plywood
- 0,118" (3 mm) PVC foam
- Personal protection (glasses, rubber gloves, long-sleeve shirt, respirator)
- Wood glue

### Make mold casing:

The goal is to make it leak-tight and strong enough to withstand water or polyurethane poured inside. Polyurethane mold consists of two parts: clock face side and mechanism side. In order to cast face part (which is cast first) you gonna need to lift the master model in mold casing to fill the space of the future mechanism side part (let's call it a stand). The M and F sides should close as precisely as possible to be able to prevent polyurethane leaking even with no sealing.

1.  Cut plywood according to the scheme [here](/Makers%20HUB/files). You can do it either manually or using a CNC router.
2.  Make a stand according to this scheme. I found a local CNC-service and made it out of 0,118" (3 mm) PVC foam. And I put plasteline inside to avoid any voids and make the stand rigid. You may try Ponoko.com service to do this.
3.  Glue the parts together using the stand as a gauge.

## Cast polyurethane mold into mold casing

<img alt="Cast polyurethane mold into mold casing" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZwdZfWi.png" /></a>

### Polyurethane mold materials:

- Smooth-on VytaFlex 40 Polyurethane 2 lbs (0.9 kg) for every mold 
- Smooth-on Universal Mold Release
- Silicone sealant
- Sulphur-Free Plasteline (e.g. Chavant NSP Sulphur-Free Plasteline)
- Paint brush (as described in Smooth-on manual)
- Big bowl (foot bath)
- Water 0,39 gal (1,5 L)
- Plastic cups
- Utility knife 
- Masking tape (Scotch tape will do)
- Scissors
- Personal protection (glasses, rubber gloves, long-sleeve shirt, respirator - follow smooth-on manual)

### Cast polyurethane mold
Polyurethane mold consists of two parts: clock face side and mechanism side (we call it face and mech).

#### Face part
1. Fill mechanism residue with plasteline.
2. Fix mold casing M side with silicone sealant or plastline, put clock stand and master-model inside, fix mold casing lid with silicone sealant or plastline, enforce with masking tape in perimeter. Let it dry if you are using silicone sealant.
3. Put the whole setup in a bowl. Pour water in. Keep pouring until you see the surface tension effect. 
4. Wait about 1 minute to see if any leakage appears. If it does fix it.
5. If no leakage appears pour all water from mold casing into bowl to the last drop. Then into a plastic cup. Divide the water between two plastic cups in halves and mark the water lines with marker. Mark one cup "Part A Mech" and the other one "Part B Mech".
6. Let mold casing dry (I give it 24 hours to make sure all water evaporates, as it affects polyurethane quality).
 
#### Pouring polyurethane
7. Put on a horizontal surface! 
8. Apply Universal Mold Release spray according to Smooth-on manual.
9. Pour A and B parts to the corresponding cup. Mix part A and part B according to smooth-on instructions (follow safety instructions as well!). Make it 2..3 mm above the mark for each component (equally).
10. Pour in the polyurethane mix with thin stream. Starting with any of the lowest (closest to table surface) points of the mold casing.
11. As soon as you have about 3 mm remaining to the top of the mold casing put the mold casing F side on top and proceed pouring polyurethane into one of the holes. If you done everything right, the mix will gradually appear in all holes (at this point polyurethane mix is less liquid - it is ok). Pour until you fill all the holes at least in half. Later those bumps on the polyurethane mold will serve for alignment.
12. Put some weight on top of the form. 2-4 lbs (1-2 kg) will be just fine.
13. Let it cure for at least 16 hours. 

#### Open the mold casing
14. Open the mold casing. Use utility knife as the polyurethane usually gets glued pretty strongly. You'll probably destroy the stand at this stage. It is all right - one day you'll make a better one. 
15. Use scissors to cut the mold flash off.
16. Pick the plasteline out the mechanism residue.
17. Clean the mold casing of silicone sealant, plasteline and remains of polyurethane.

#### Mech part
18. Assemble the mold casing with Face part and master-model inside. Fix mold casing F side with silicone sealant or plasteline. Fix mold casing lid with silicone sealant or plasteline, enforce with masking tape in perimeter. Let it dry if you are using silicone sealant.
19. Pour polyurethane (repeat steps 3-17).
20. Clean all parts of remains of Universal mold release with some clothes. Some laziness allowed as it will come off after 2-3 concrete castings. 
21. Sign mech and face parts.
22. Celebrate.

## Cast concrete into polyurethane mold

### Materials

- Water 
- Concrete (I use grade M400, but feel free to experiment)
- Personal safety (respirator, rubber gloves)
- Bucket to mix concrete.
- Screw gun with mixing rod or just a spoon (spoon is enough to mix concrete  for 1-3 clocks).
- Kitchen scales
- Putty spatula 
- Kitchen sponge
- Wood round file

### Pouring concrete

<a href="https://goo.gl/exzVkN">
<img alt="Pouring concrete and Assemble Concrete Clock 1355" src="http://i.imgur.com/muhD21p.png" /></a>

Shake well, follow proportions thoroughly.

1.  Assemble the form with scotch as in the picture.
2.  Make concrete mix. Mix 29,3 oz (830 gr) of water with 8,2 oz (233 gr) of concrete (cement powder) for each casting.
3.  Pour concrete using the spoon into the mold and shake well after every 1/3 of the volume gets filled.
4.  Keep pouring concrete until the level rises above the mold a little bit.
5.  Use spatula to remove the excess of concrete.
6.  Put the lid on and fix it with scotch tape.
7.  If you want to eliminate bubbles from the front side of the clock, rotate the mold in your arms so that the mech part faces up. Give it a few slight punches. Put at a horizontal surface. If you want more bubbles put the form vertically or even put it facing the face part up.
8.  Wait for at least 8 hours (depending on your concrete type).
9.  Open the form 
10. Use file to clear the mechanism hole.
11. Use kitchen sponge to polish the clock a bit and get rid of dusty feeling or just leave it untouched.
12. Celebrate.

## Contribution requests

**Spelling and grammar**
Would appreciate spelling correction very much. 

**Master-model strength and leak-tightness**.
Currently I use rice to strengthen the model and plastic to seal the bottom hole. It is enough for casting, but I would like to make it better. I tried to use melted plasteline, but it gives to much shrinkage. I suggest using some cement mix and fill the form with it. Try using very fluid mix and cover the insides with thin layer. Then let it dry and make another one. As soon as model gets enough rigidity pour the rest of the mix in. I guess polyurethane may be used the same way, but maybe there are any other quickly-drying materials to make this process faster? 

**A stronger clock stand**. 
Need a technology to make a more durable stand (Make mold casing paragraph). The purpose of the stand is to preserve 1 mm facet and clock form.

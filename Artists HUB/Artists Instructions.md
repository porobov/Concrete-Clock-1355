# Concrete Clock 1355. Artists HUB.

We want diversity to come into our project from the outside. This is one of the reasons we make only one model. We encourage people to paint Concrete Clock 1355 the way they like. We believe this is the way to deliver true art. Feel free to participate, paint your own clock and tell other people about it using our official hashtag #ConcreteClock1355.
